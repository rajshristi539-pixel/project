<font size-5><PRE> Infant Jesus School is widely regarded as a premier choice for education because of its unwavering commitment to holistic development and academic excellence. 
Families choose this institution because it transcends traditional rote learning, focusing instead on nurturing a child’s mind, body, and spirit through a balanced 
CBSE curriculum and a richCS array of extracurricular activities like sports, music, and the arts.

 The school is particularly noted for its experienced and dedicated faculty who provide personalized attention, fostering a safe, inclusive, and "student-first" 
environment where children feel valued and motivated. Beyond the classroom, the school emphasizes character building and moral integrity, 
instilling core values such as empathy, discipline, and social responsibility. With state-of-the-art facilities—including smart classrooms, modern science labs, and secure,
 CCTV-monitored campuses—
Infant Jesus School provides the ideal foundation for students to become confident, lifelong learners and responsible global citizens.

Infant jesus do not only provide education, it provides confidence, hope, support and a ability to become a good citizen.</PRE></font>
